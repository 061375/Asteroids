- (maybe) a boss of some kind ... something silly and inappropriate (thinking Monty Python)
-- A Donald Trump boss throwing hamburgers and yelling "They're eating the dogs! They're eating the cats!"
-- Followed by the "real" boss Elon shooting starships at you ( but luckily half of them blow up before they even get close ) The starships will have the first stage and the upper stage will detach and and actually veer towards Trump ( on purpose but not on purpose ). If it hits Trump it will damage him. When he dies Elon will hold up flags and cheer with "much rejoicing" ( i.e. Holy Grail ). They will both have FAT baby bodies
