# Asteroids !!

## Jeremy Heminger <contact@jeremyheminger.com>

#### Built without AI  *mostly*  - sort of an homage to : [Kickass!](https://kickassapp.com)
I originally built a little easter egg into an intranet app at work. In the login if the user gave the secret user name and password that was *not very* surreptitiously nested in the HTML source of the login page, then a simple Asteroids game would appear. However once I started playing with it, *over time*, it started to evolve into a project at home on my own time.
