# Asteroids !!

#### @about Built without AI  *mostly*  - sort of an homage to : [Kickass!](https://kickassapp.com)
I originally built a little easter egg into an intranet app. In the login if the user gave the secret user name and password that was *not very* surreptitiously nested in the HTML source of the login page. Then a simple Asteroids game would appear. This the the boss is coming button that would redirect the page. However once I started playing with it, *over time*, it started to evolve.
